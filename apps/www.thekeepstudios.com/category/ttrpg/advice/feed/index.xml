<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Generating 5e Characters Using DCC RPG</h2>



<p>So there you are, you&#8217;ve finally convinced your friend to play. After all the stories of the adventure and excitement they are ready to dive in, roll dice, kill monsters and loot some treasure! Yet, instead of adventuring you&#8217;re fumbling through rules to build a character for  40 minutes. They&#8217;re getting bored. What&#8217;s all this math?! They quit. This game isn&#8217;t fun, it&#8217;s just homework.</p>



<p> What if there was another way?  Today I&#8217;ll explain the logic, and design behind our <a href="/2019/02/19/5e-background-the-legendary-survivor/">5e Background: Legendary&nbsp;Survivor</a>.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re already convinced, or need to reference the guide quickly check out the <a href="/2019/02/19/5e-background-the-legendary-survivor/">Legendary&nbsp;Survivor</a> for a summary of the character creation method.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">The Why</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">A Case For The Randomly Generated Character</h4>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile tyranny-media"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="390" height="330" src="/static/content/uploads/2019/02/falcon-seal-illustration-1.svg" alt="Illustration of a Double Headed Eagle in the Style of Royal Seal" class="wp-image-1597 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">The Tyranny Of Choice</h5>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. Never let anyone deny that.</p>



<p>There is however a phenomenon known as The Tyranny of Choice. Logically having choices should make all the players at the table happier! In small numbers of choices this remains is true, but an abundance of choice leads to misery. This has been proven in scientific research(<a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/Sci.Amer.pdf">Scientific America &#8211; The Tyranny of Choice by Barry Schwartz</a>) and trust me it&#8217;s been proven anecdotally at my table.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">EXCESSIVE choice is a burden. Critical decisions that will live with you for long periods of time, begets more regret than the positive feelings generated by the choices.</p>
</div></div>



<p>We&#8217;ve ALL experienced this. You get asked what to arrange your ability scores, what  race you want, then class, then ability options, then gear, and then, and then, and then ad nauseum until you&#8217;re TIRED of making choices.  Maybe you haven&#8217;t even played this game before and you have to pick a million things you&#8217;re going to be <em>STUCK </em>with?! That&#8217;s a lot of potential regret.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mean to imply that  everyone suffers from this when playing 5e, however it is very real for some, particularly new players. They may be overwhelmed by the choices or EVEN WORSE get bored of the game before the <em>game&nbsp;</em>begins due to the long and rules context heavy character creation. I can hear you all, those wise sages who exclaim that a character can be made in no time! Why, you can create one in less than five minutes! Well, yes, YOU can. You also know all the choices, and aren&#8217;t really &#8220;making&#8221; many of the choices at that time, having already subconsciously made those choices before hand.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Just Play</h5>



<p>What if you could literally roll up characters in about 5 minutes(OR LESS), and start playing right away? What if you could make a single character with literally 2 choices? Now what if those choices were &#8220;Name&#8221; and &#8220;Alignment&#8221;? What if&#8230; you could never &#8220;make the character wrong&#8221; in your first game?</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-dark-gray-color has-white-background-color has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size">What if you sat down <strong>JUST PLAYED</strong> and had an adventure? Sound interesting? Ok, then let&#8217;s give it a try.</p>



<div style="height:100px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">The How</h3>



<p>So the key difference between 5e and DCCs character creation is that instead of building out your ENTIRE hero, you start with a small set of common folk. Instead of deciding on race, class and background you&#8217;re free to <em>discover</em> these things for yourself. Moreover, since you will be starting with a small set of simplified characters, usually about 4, you are now free to make bold decisions and tempt fate from stage one! </p>



<p>So here is a step by step conversion of the initial character creation, what changes in the first adventure (i.e. the zero level &#8216;funnel&#8217; adventure).</p>

We found our first hurdle. FEAR NOT, there is a solution. You see the folks over at Goodman Games decided to use different ability scores. THE FOOLS. How dare they! Don&#8217;t they realize these ability scores are actually a lot easier to explain to new players!? Erm. Well, anyways, lets go about undoing their good work, because you&#8217;re planning to use these characters in 5e!

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Building the Character</h4>



<p>For now, we don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to worry about the ability scores mismatch. First we head over to <a href="/2019/02/05/starting-out-with-dcc/">Get started&nbsp;with&nbsp;DCC</a> and make characters with the standard DCC method . YES this includes rolling 3d6 for each ability score in order, no we don&#8217;t skip this, yes trust me we&#8217;ll be able to play whatever you want in 5e. We&#8217;ll get to the &#8220;expected competence level&#8221; later</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Getting the Races Right</h5>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve created some characters, you&#8217;ll want to add in the possibility that you&#8217;re of some of the &#8220;rare&#8221; races. When, and ONLY when you&#8217;ve rolled a human, roll a d12. On a 1-7  the character remains human, but on a 8-12 they are one of the &#8216;rare&#8217; races (dragonborn, tiefling, gnome, half-orc or half-elf). Each race gets one number, so there is a 1 in 12 chance of any given &#8216;rare&#8217; race. This works out nicely in making an interesting variety normally present in 5e, but retaining the rare races  exotic feel.</p>
</div></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Expected Competence Level</h5>



<p>Of course, <em>3d6 ability scores</em> will never measure up to the <em>highest 3 of 4d6 ability score</em>. We can break this down visually by observing the ability distributions.  </p>

The overall curve is reasonably similar, enough so that it would not be game breaking to ignore the curve difference on total ability points. </p></div></div>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">The Fix<strong> </strong></h6>



<p>These observations can show us our path to designing an ability score conversion. We need the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A way to close the 10 point ability point total gap.</li>



<li>A method of fixing the Ability Score Mismatch. Specifically the lack of Wisdom/Charisma, and the excess Personality/Luck.</li>



<li>A way of mitigating punishing low rolls.</li>
</ul>



<p>We can resolve these issues with three clever steps.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Change Personality into Wisdom OR Charisma (This corrects one missing ability score)</li>



<li>Assign the OTHER missing ability score the value of the current third highest ability score. <br></li>



<li>Spend each point of Luck to increase any ability score by one point, then remove Luck. The maximum of any ability score is 18 plus any racial modifiers.<br></li>
</ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An Example.</p>



<p> Our character is a  Dragonborn with the ability scores are 14; 12; 11; 10; 8; 6. We chose Charisma as our Personality replacement, so we now have an 11 Wisdom. has ability scores are 14; 12; 11; 11; 10; 8 with a 6 Luck. We increase our ability scores by a total of 6, to and end result of 18; 12; 12; 12; 10; 8. We COULD have spent all of our Luck and increased our Strength to 20 due to our +2 racial ability score max, but we decided that our Dragonborn should have three positive modifiers instead. </p>
</blockquote>



<div style="clear: both;"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Works</h3>



<p>Duplicating our third highest ability score closes the gap between DCC ability score totals, and 5e ability score totals. Consulting the table below we can see that the mean ability score total difference between DCC ability scores and 5e ability scores is approximately 10 points. We can ALSO see that the mean score for the third highest DCC score is 11.  This means, on average our conversion is ever so slightly better ability score total. This seems fair, as the player will have had to earn this character, and a slight advantage on average is a fair reward. Honestly, no player is going  to really notice unless they read this article, because the advantage is so very small that on an individual character it would not be obvious.</p>



<p>Reassigning the points from luck also give the player some customization. In our example we used the WORST case scenario, where luck is the lowest stat and gives us the least customization. This still allows us to have an 18 or higher stat without issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table alignwide has-fixed-layout is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><td>Ability</td><td>Mean</td><td>Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DCC System total</td><td>63</td><td>7.245688373</td></tr><tr><td>5e System total</td><td>73.46759259</td><td>6.973316268</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 1st Highest Ability</td><td>14.23311854</td><td>1.769333933</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 2nd Highest Ability</td><td>12.45330467</td><td>1.607596575</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 3rd Highest Ability</td><td>11.11916922</td><td>1.549240782</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 4th Highest Ability</td><td>9.880830784</td><td>1.549240782</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 5th Highest Ability</td><td>8.546695332</td><td>1.607596575</td></tr><tr><td>DCC 6th Highest Ability</td><td>6.766881459</td><td>1.769333933</td></tr><tr><td>5e 1st Highest Ability</td><td>15.66188627</td><td>1.427252688</td></tr><tr><td>5e 2nd Highest Ability</td><td>14.17422788</td><td>1.43733651</td></tr><tr><td>5e 3rd Highest Ability</td><td>12.95510793</td><td>1.463966632</td></tr><tr><td>5e 4th Highest Ability</td><td>11.76092951</td><td>1.529983986</td></tr><tr><td>5e 5th Highest Ability</td><td>10.4113565</td><td>1.65804591</td></tr><tr><td>5e 6th Highest Ability</td><td>8.504084501</td><td>1.949020768</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">The Worst Case Scenario</h6>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s presume the &#8220;players nightmare&#8221; where they want their character to have a class which relies on their second worst ability, and their luck score is their lowest ability. For sake of argument let&#8217;s use a stereotypical wizard. The player&#8217;s character has an 8 intelligence, and a 6 luck. Since this is a character chosen from 4 other characters it can easily be presumed that their other ability scores are reasonably high in comparison, so we will presume they do not need to improve their other scores. This leaves us with a 14 intelligence, which is perfectly serviceable! Remember that this was the WORST case, which means that the character must have had SOME redeeming characteristic to make it this far.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">The EVEN Worse Case Scenario</h6>



<p>I hear you though, this is a lot of chance and the possibility that the only remaining character is just <em>garbage</em> at the end. Well that&#8217;s no fun! I can hear your Judge/Dungeon Master screaming now! &#8220;My players would be pissed if they had a character with stats that bad, and I don&#8217;t want to have a scrub character in my game!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hold on, hold on that is ALSO easily fixed. Remember that Luck can be gained and lost in DCC, and it makes sense that the gods who safeguard adventurers would smile on the wayward soul who sought treasure and glory against all odds. If the character&#8217;s new ability total is LESS than 66 they should gain enough Luck to spend to make up the difference. This brings them within one standard deviation of the average power of a normally generated 5e character.</p>

<p>So there you are, staring at your die rolls and realizing you&#8217;re going to have to play a &#8220;bad&#8221; character. </p>

<p>

This sucks, am I right? Of course it doesn&#8217;t feel good. I&#8217;m not going to sugar coat things, but I am going to skip all the math of how they aren&#8217;t &#8220;that bad&#8221; and tell you the story of Goggin.

</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover has-background-dim has-parallax aligncenter is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow" style="background-image:url(/static/content/uploads/2019/01/jonathan-petersson-614702-unsplash.jpg)"><p class="wp-block-cover-text"> <br>Goggin, the halfling that wouldn&#8217;t survive </p></div>



<p>Goggin was, for lack of a better term, screwed from the get go. Goggin began life as a 0 level funnel character, the least impressive of 4 his player had. Honestly, the only thing Goggin had going for him was the &#8220;halfling&#8221; part of his profession, and with a garbage luck state he wasn&#8217;t even the most promising halfling candidate.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s poor Goggin, dressed in cloth exploring a dungeon when he, because he&#8217;s not really &#8220;worth&#8221; keeping away from danger, explores a well and falls into a pit of pure chaos. He gets dragged out, loses his nose and gets a snake tongue in the process from mutation with no benefits. Life as a PC is over for Goggin for sure, right? Of course, anybody can see that.</p>



<p>&#8230; Apparently anybody but chaos magic mad Goggin.</p>



<p>You see, we didn&#8217;t know it, but apparently he was born with crap stats, no loot, no hope and not a single fuck in the world to give.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Goggin. Was. A. Terror.</h3>



<p>Possible trap? Goggin&#8217;ll check it. Suspicious potion? Bottoms up bitches. Party can&#8217;t decide what to do? Too late, Goggin already pulled the lever. Tentacled horror reaching into the boat? Must want to be friends, feed it a chicken.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. Goggin was always trying stuff. No sitting about for him, he was rolling dice and doing. And you know what? That math? Turns out, when you roll all the time, you get a lot more 20s&#8230; and you get a lot more stories.</p>



<p>All those players with &#8220;good&#8221; characters? Notice how scared they are all the time? Notice that they &#8220;can&#8217;t die&#8221;? Goggin&#8217;s player didn&#8217;t mind. Who cares, he dies and we&#8217;re out&#8230; what &#8230; some crazy mook with bad stats?</p>



<p>At the end of the adventure, we&#8217;re all sitting there choosing our PC from our survivors. Goggin&#8217;s player picks his sheet up, and picks up his quite good dwarf. Looks at us.</p>



<p> And we all bid a fond farewell&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Farewell to the Dwarf. Long live Goggin.</h3>



<p>Those other guys, they have heroes. Heroes need to live to do heroic things. But Goggin was no hero. He was a legend.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s my lesson. Don&#8217;t be like those other scared player. Ride Cthulhu into battle. Make love to the scorpion queen. Drink random potions that turn your eyes black and taste like cherries. Make friends with angles(no you heard me, not angels, angles), and enemies of kings. Challenge dragons to drinking contests and host wet t-shirt parties for ogres.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Whatever you do,&nbsp;<em>don&#8217;t be a Hero.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Be a Legend.</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>Be Goggin.</strong></em></p>

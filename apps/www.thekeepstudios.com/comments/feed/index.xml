Should be fixed by direct image embedding. Best I can do unfortunately, though I can also share my original anydice program as well. https://anydice.com/program/13afa]]></description>

Yeah, sorry I&#039;m working on that. It&#039;s quite annoying but for some reason due to our google settings we apparently can&#039;t publicly publish things to the web. If I find a solution I&#039;ll be updating this post.]]></description>

Completely agreed. I love DCC of course, and it&#039;s my go to for introducing new players to my game or &quot;breaking in&quot; certain groups. I also love 5e for being so solid, flexible and respectful of my/the players time, so I love to blend them together.

I do agree that if you took EVERYTHING from DCC to play 5e you might as well just play DCC, but it is fun to mix and match to come up with your own homebrew game. Sometimes I like to say &quot;this area runs on DCC rules X, Y and Z because things are weird and out of control here&quot; just to ramp up the feeling of chaos in an area of my world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you really wanted to go this route, the DM could just write a custom Occupations table using the racial mix they want to see in their campaign. Or ignore the race component on the main occupation table and also roll for race. 
You could have a whole series of &quot;how to use this cool bit from DCC in 5e&quot; if you wanted to. There are a LOT of cool bits.
But just playing DCC is probably a better solution.]]></description>
